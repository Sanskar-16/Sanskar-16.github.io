## Projects worked on 
### 1. Kaggle Housing project 

![Ranked kaggle housing project](Resources/KaggleHousingProject.png)
- This project was based on prediction of the housing prices. The attibutes which define the price in a certain way were given, One had to get the right attributes together and remove the ones which alter the price in negative way to predict the prices in the most accurate manner. I did this project with a team of six other members, We all achieved a score of 0.16164 (RMSE) as the best score.  
- RMSE also knows as Root mean square error is the deviation of the residuals, Residals are a meausre of how far from the regression line data points are.
