## Personal profile    
I am a BSc Data Science student, looking for a placement/internship opportunity. I have dedicated much of my life to community support work and have excellent customer service skills as a result of being a good communicator. I speak three languages and I have extensive programming skills, which I enjoy using for open-sourced coding projects. I have worked on lots of volunteering projects and various jobs throughout my studies at the university.

## Projects worked on 

### 1. [Capstone Project (dissertaion for third year)](https://github.com/Sanskar-16/capstone)

### 2. [Natural Language Engineering](https://github.com/Sanskar-16/NLE-assignment)

### 3. [My own twitter data analysis](https://github.com/Sanskar-16/twitter)

### 4. [My own spotify data analysis](https://github.com/Sanskar-16/spotify)

### 5. [Analysis on F1 data](https://github.com/Sanskar-16/f1)

### 6. [A COVID-19 modelling and forecast tool](https://github.com/Sanskar-16/covid-project)  

- This project was a part of the module CE291 Team project challenge in my second year. The requirements were to create a modelling and forecasting tool using data available online. 
- We used Piecewise linear regression algorithm to predict the graph.
- We have also included a colour-coded map, which shows the number of cases in a region based on colours.
- Another feature that our product entails is the country comparison tab which as the name suggests compares two countries and shows various metrics for their data.

Languages used - Java, HTML, Python.

### 7. [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://github.com/Sanskar-16/house-price-new)

![Ranked kaggle housing project](Resources/KaggleHousingProject.png)
- This project was based on a prediction of the housing prices using feature engineering, RFs and gradient boosting. The attributes which define the price in a certain way were given, One had to get the right attributes together and remove the ones which alter the price in an undesirable way to predict the prices in the most accurate manner. I did this project with a team of six other members, We all achieved a score of 0.16164 (RMSE) as the best score.  
- RMSE also knows as Root mean square error is the deviation of the residuals, Residuals are a measure of how far from the regression line data points are.
- We initially based our predictions on random forest which is a simple yet diverse machine learning algorithm. Moving forward we realised XGBoost produced better results for us. XGBoost is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance.

![Project score](Resources/KaggleHousingProjectRank.png)
- Language/Libraries used - python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, NumPy, scipy, sklearn)
- Algorithms used - random forest, XGBoost.

### 8. [Titanic - ML from disaster](https://github.com/Sanskar-16/titanic)

![Titanic](Resources/Titanic2.png)

I started this project to gain basic insights into ML and how kaggle works. I achieved a score of 0.775 compared to the best score of 1. The competition uses machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. I do plan on improving my score once I learn more algorithms and have a better understanding of the dataset.

Languages/libraries used - Python (pandas, NumPy)
