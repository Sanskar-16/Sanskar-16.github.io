## Personal profile    
I am a BSc Data Science student, looking for a placement/internship opportunity. I have dedicated much of my life to community support work and have excellent customer service skills as a result of being a good communicator. I speak three languages and I have extensive programming skills, which I enjoy using for open-sourced coding projects. I have worked on lots of volunteering projects and various jobs throughout my studies at the university.

## Projects worked on 
### 1. House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques.

![Ranked kaggle housing project](Resources/KaggleHousingProject.png)
- This project was based on prediction of the housing prices using feature engineering, RFs and gradient boosting. The attibutes which define the price in a certain way were given, One had to get the right attributes together and remove the ones which alter the price in an undesiable way to predict the prices in the most accurate manner. I did this project with a team of six other members, We all achieved a score of 0.16164 (RMSE) as the best score.  
- RMSE also knows as Root mean square error is the deviation of the residuals, Residals are a meausre of how far from the regression line data points are.
- We initally based our predictions off of random forest which is a simple yet diverse machine learning algorithm. Moving forward we realised XGBoost produced better results for us. XGBoost is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance.

![Project score](Resources/KaggleHousingProjectRank.png)
- Language/Libraries used - python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, sklearn)
- Algorithms used - random forest, XGBoost.

### 2. A COVID-19 modeling and forecast tool  

- This project was a part of the module CE291 Team project challenge in my second year. The requirements were to create a modelling and forcasting tool using data avaialable online. 
- We used Piecewise linear regression algorithm to predict the graph.
- We have also included a colour coded map, which shows the nuber of cases in a region based on colours.
- Another feature which our product entails is the country comparison tab which as the name suggests compares two countries and shows various metrics for their data.
